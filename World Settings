If you want to chose any of d&d 5e languages then you need to chose the language which is common in your campaign otherwise you can chose any of your wishing languages from the d&d 5e Standard languages table. But whenever we want to chose a language for our character from the d&d 5e Exotic languages table you must have a permission of the GM’s, so with this permission you also have a chance to get the secret language like thieves can’t or tongue of druids.

From the above list of the 5e best languages we can use the “Ignan” as the “obscure languages” and it will serve you its level best unless you’re at the sea.

How To Chose A New Language From 5e Languages
We can get so many languages, when we have the below specifications with us and once you chose the new 5e language then you can easily interact with your families before of your enemies. So let us start the steps to get a new language for you d&d character.

To begin “First Level” we have to know at least any of the “Two 5e Languages”
Your Character Default language will be indicated by your “Race”
If you have picked up “Half-Elf” or any other different “Race” then there you can access more languages.
For instance you’ve picked up the “Half-Elf”, so you can approach the “Dungeon Master” and he will provide some “Additional Learning Languages”. You no need to worry about your “INT Score” because it won’t “Affect”.
With your “Background” also you can get the access to chose one or more “Extra Languages”. But it does use for the “Particular Task”
It’s mandatory to maintain the “Character Sheet” to write the details of that “Initial Languages” after you’ve selected
From the “Standard Languages Table“ only you have to chose your language, but the language should be “Common In Your Campaign”
If you want to chose the language from the “Exotic Languages Table“, you should get the “Consent From The Dungeon Master”.
The “Exotic Languages Table“ will provide the language which “Thieves And Other Oppositions Unable To Speak Or Understand”
“Speak Language Skill” is better to purchase than getting the rank through the any skill you have.
By learning more languages you have to enhance your character levels. So the above procedure is the only way to get more learning languages and you have great chances to chose the best 5e languages either from the “Standard Languages“ or from the “Exotic Languages“.
